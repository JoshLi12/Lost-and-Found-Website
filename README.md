# Lost-and-Found-Website
**Description**: A website designed to digitalize my high school's lost and found system. 

**Motivation**: Students are typically busy during their lunch break filled with meetings, clubs, and councils, and often find it difficult to visit the lost and found during lunch, which is the only time it can be open. To help, I created a website to digitalize the lost and found, so students can view their lost items 24/7, saving them time during their busy academic day. 

**Technologies**: JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Node, Git, Firebase (database for images), and MongoDB (database for item information).
